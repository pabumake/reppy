# REPpy Remove Excel Passwords with python

## What is this for?

Well this Tool is made to remove the excel spreadsheet passwords because users forgot passwords a hundred times.
VBA's were just to complicated or have Excel version specific options.

## What it does not

Remove the Encrypted Passwords from Excel Files.
If you cannot open the Excel File to atleast read its Content you need to look for other Tools.

## Tested:

Currently Tested with Excel Versions 2010,2013,2016

O365 to come

If you use older Versions of excel you can give it a try but i cannot guarantee.

Requirements:

Create a Folder called import. Place your excel file/s inside and run the script.


Happy Password Removing ^^
